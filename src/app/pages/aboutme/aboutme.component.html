                Hello, I'm Sergio Toledo, a software engineer with a strong background in Control and Automation Engineering.
                I recently graduated from Georgian College's Computer Programming program and am currently working as a Software Engineer,
                where I focus on full-stack development, creating innovative solutions that enhance efficiency and make a meaningful impact.
            </p>
            <p class="line-height-3 mt-0 mb-3 p-0">
                My journey in technology is rooted in curiosity and a drive to bridge the gap between engineering and practical problem-solving.
                I transitioned from a production management role, where I honed my understanding of industrial workflows, to software development,
                motivated by the potential to craft tools that streamline operations and foster innovation.
            </p>
            <p class="line-height-3 my-0 p-0">
                During my 8-month internship with Ontario Power Generation, I worked on projects that transformed business process monitoring and management.
                I developed web applications and data analytics tools, led the creation of a Project Charter for a major renovation project,
                automated operational reminders using Python, and leveraged Power BI to turn complex data into actionable insights.
            </p>
